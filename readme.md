vBulletin CLI Reader
=========================

This is a small python program that takes a link to a vBulletin thread, keeps track of how much you've read, and presents you with new posts every time you run `vbr [thread name]`.

How?
---------------------------
	$ pip install vbulletin-reader
	$ vbr [thread url] [thread name]
	$ vbr [thread name]
	
Why?
--------------------------
Realistically, there's only one vBulletin website I keep up with, and that's [The Source](http://www.mtgthesource.com/) for MTG, and there's only one thread in that I care about, which is the [Sneak & Show thread](http://www.mtgthesource.com/forums/showthread.php?27217-Deck-Sneak-and-Show/). I found it annoying to have to open up a webpage and navigate through just to check new posts, so I figured I'd write a quick & dirty python program to get it.
